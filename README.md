# Cimmino's Method

Cimmino's method is an iterative technique used to find the numerical solution of linear systems. It works by projecting the solution onto hyperplanes corresponding to the system's equations, gradually converging to the final solution.

This project includes:
- C code implementation of Cimmino's method.
- A private video presentation (available upon request).
- A presentation and report, both done in Overleaf (LaTeX editor).
- The LaTeX files for the project, provided in a `.zip` file.
